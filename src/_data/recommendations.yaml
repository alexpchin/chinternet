  content: Alex is like the secret love child of Mark Zuckerberg and Alexa Chung. (Hmm, they're too young, maybe Steve Jobs and Debbie Harry?) Well, either way he's the sort of genius who teaches himself PHP for fun, and manages to soften his full geekiness with his effortlessly stylish, and confident outward appearance. I'm looking forward to saying I worked with Alex before he was famous, and my friends saying "Why the hell didn't you get paid in shares?

  content: "'Great teachers make learning fun' is a phrase often manifested with greater emphasis placed on the 'fun' element than the 'learning' element. Alex's teaching however cultivates an environment which naturally makes learning in his classes fun. His lessons sparked my interest in an entirely new subject and his direction guided me to pursue those specific areas which challenged and inspired me. I plan to carry on down some of the avenues Alex introduced me to and it is thanks to his teaching that I have the foundation skill set to be able to do so."

- name: Andrea Mckenzie
  content: Alex was my instructor at General Assembly for their Web Development Immersive course, his enthusiasm for web development is clear to see. He has experience across a wide range of areas. We covered a number of topics at breakneck speed and yet I felt with Alex’s guidance and explanations I got a good grounding in what we were learning. JavaScript, NodeJs, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, were some of the topics covered in more depth, and even those not covered greatly Alex was able to offer help or suggest resources if students were interested. I liked how he is very hands on, willing to sit with students and help them with their code, and offer further explanations if need, also his ability to engage students of different levels was great. One of the things Alex also encouraged was a great team spirit through the social activities we did as a group, this I feel was also important as the developer community is not just about technical aspects, but also building and sharing skills and knowledge together, and this was encouraged by Alex. I would fully endorse him as an instructor and as a passionate and knowledgeable developer.
