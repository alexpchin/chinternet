Alex's teaching however cultivates an environment which naturally makes learning in his classes fun. His lessons sparked my interest in an entirely new subject and his direction guided me to pursue those specific areas which challenged and inspired me.

Alex goes way beyond the call of duty to make sure the class understands a particular point, at times helping students remotely outside of working hours. On the technical side, Alex has knowledge of code that goes beyond the normal level, taking into account factors such as design patterns for optimal performance. Now the best part. Personality: Vibrant, energetic and genuinely cool guy to be around, with a consistent big smile that gets and keeps the camaraderie going.

He has experience across a wide range of areas. We covered a number of topics at breakneck speed and yet I felt with Alexâ€™s guidance and explanations I got a good grounding in what we were learning. JavaScript, NodeJs, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, were some of the topics covered in more depth, and even those not covered greatly Alex was able to offer help or suggest resources if students were interested. I liked how he is very hands on, willing to sit with students and help them with their code, and offer further explanations if need, also his ability to engage students of different levels was great. One of the things Alex also encouraged was a great team spirit through the social activities we did as a group, this I feel was also important as the developer community is not just about technical aspects, but also building and sharing skills and knowledge together, and this was encouraged by Alex. I would fully endorse him as an instructor and as a passionate and knowledgeable developer."</span> - <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mckenzieandrea" target="_blank">Andrea Mckenzie</a>
